    <h1>Count Wisely</h1><br>
    <p>One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in the courtroom puzzled. As they all tried
         to figure out the answer, Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was. They repeated the question to him
         .The question was, “How many crows are there in the city?” Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar.<br>
          He announced the answer; he said there were twenty-one thousand, five hundred and twenty-three crows in the city
          . When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal replied, “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are more,
           then the relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby cities. If there are fewer, then the crows from
            our city must be visiting their relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the answer, Akbar presented
             Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.
