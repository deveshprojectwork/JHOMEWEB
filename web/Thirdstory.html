    <h1>The Eagle</h1><br>
    <p>On a hot summer day, a fox wandered across the jungle in order to get
         some food. He was very hungry and desperately in search of food.
            He searched everywhere, but couldn’t find anything that he could eat
         His stomach was rumbling and his search continued. Soon he reached
          a vineyard which was laden with juicy grapes. The fox looked around
           to check if he was safe from the hunters. No one was around, so he
            decided to steal some grapes. He jumped high and high, but he
             couldn’t reach the grapes. The grapes were too high but he 
             refused to give up.<br> The fox jumped high in the air to catch the
              grapes in his mouth, but he missed. He tried once more but 
              missed again. He tried a few more times, but couldn’t reach.
               It was getting dark and the fox was getting angry. His legs
                hurt, so he gave up in the end. Walking away, he said, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”<br>
             <h2>Moral of the Story</h2>
            We pretend to hate something when we can’t have it.
