    <h1>The Golden Touch</h1><br>
    <p>Once there lived a greedy man in a small town. He was very rich, 
        and he loved gold and all things fancy. But he loved his daughter more
         anything. One day, he chanced upon a fairy.<br> The fairy’s hair was caught
         in a few tree branches. He helped her out, but as his greediness took
         , he realised that he had an opportunity to become richer by asking for a
          wish in return (by helping her out). The fairy granted him a wish. 
          He said, “All that I touch should turn to gold.” And his wish was granted
           by the grateful fairy. The greedy man rushed home to tell his wife and daughter about
            his wish, all the while touching stones and pebbles and watching them convert into gold. 
            Once he got home, his daughter rushed to greet him. As soon as he bent down to scoop her up in
             his arms, she turned into a gold statue. He was devastated and started crying and trying to bring his
              daughter back to life. He realised his folly and spent the rest of his days searching for the fairy 
              to take away his wish.
        
       <h2> Moral of the Story</h2>
        Greed will always lead to downfall.
