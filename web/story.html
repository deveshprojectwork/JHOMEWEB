The eaglets were crying out of hunger. “I should feed one of the cubs to my children,” the eagle decided and swooped down to pick one up. The eagle fed her friend’s one of the cubs. When the mother fox returned, she saw the eagle feeding her child to her babies. “What have you done?” she asks the eagle, crying all the while. The poor mother fox was heartbroken and in pain. “You have cheated a friend, a good friend,” she cried as she took her cubs and left never to see the eagle again.

    <h2 id="secondstory">A wise old owl story</h2>
    <p>This is a wise old owl story for kids. Once upon a time, a group of owls came to settle in a forest.
         This forest had many beautiful lush green trees. All the owls in the group were free to choose whichever tree they 
         liked. So, the young owls greedily chose all the green trees. There they built their new homes.<br/><br/>


        However, there was an old owl also amongst them. He was forced to build his nest in an old, dried up oak tree.
         Without much of a choice, the old owl settled there. Also,

As time went by, the younger owls became too proud of their beautiful homes. “Hey old man, couldn’t you find a better tree for your nest,” the younger owls teased the older one. “We are so lucky,” they would say, “Our nests have beautiful trees unlike yours!” With old age, comes wisdom and this old owl was wise too. So, he smiled and said, “It is too early to say which one of us is lucky.”
